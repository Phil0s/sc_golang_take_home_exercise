package folders

/* My understanding; of pagination in relation to this code, is that I have to display a limited amount of folders
'per page' if this was an app/website. I am not sure what the token part is exactly, but Im assuming it is very similar to
people clicking 'next' page, etc to see the next set of data. So I plan in the terminal, to ask the user for an
input like next or back (0/1, etc) which will simulate flipping. Then the code will display two folders at a
time and moving up or down the list */

// Written in main, check stage two comments. I'm not sure if I did this step correctly, I am confused on how to implement
// Pagniation.
